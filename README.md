# tulip

hai :3 tulip is a vanilla rpg-esc, vaguely hypixel skyblock-inspired, work-in-progress experience in minecraft. it features professions, leveling systems, xp boosters, quests, villager shops, and even more is planned for the future :3

this datapack contains many sub-datapacks in the `data` folder, those used to be separate repos but have now been included together:
- `tulip` (stem)
- `tulip_biome`
- `tulip_currency`
- `tulip_housing`
- `tulip_item`
- `tulip_quest`
- `tulip_skill`
- `tulip_transport`
